									<h2>Dinos Athletics, University of Calgary | September 2024 - Present</h2>
									<h6>Athlete Development Assistant</h6>
									<p> In my practicum, I work with the wrestling and women's basketball Dinos teams during their strength and conditioning sessions to help further develop the athletes
										and practice translating my biomechanics knowledge in practice. When attending practices or competition I visually analyse movements of the athletes to identify 
										weaknesses then work with the strength & conditioning team to build targeted training solutions. In weekly meetings, we collaborate and discuss athletic development strategies, address 
										successes and concerns from the previous week and update on upcoming events.

									<p>In my role as an Undergraduate Researcher, I've learned to balance evolving challenges and adapt to the dynamic nature of research in academia. 
										Presenting in poster presentations with audiences ranging from the general public 
										to experts in biomechanics, allowed me to evolve my communications skills to fit the target audiences' knowledge base.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Athlete monitoring:</b> We worked directly with University of Calgary athletes during pre-season baseline testing and in-season athlete monitoring
											which includes jump testing and maximal strength testing on a robotic leg press.</li>
										<li><b>Data Analysis:</b> Dynamically implemented the use of R and Matlab for statistical parametric curve analysis.</li>

									<ul>
										<li><b>Market Research:</b> In this project, I used current Track and Field competition results to summarize regions of interest for the company.</li>
										<li><b>Literature Review:</b> I explored lower back instability during high speed sprinting, where I learned the importance of core 
											engagement and applied this knowledge to coaching protocols for track athletes in an article for <a href="https://issuu.com/renaissancepublishing/docs/techniquesproof?fr=xKAE9_zU1NQ">Techniques Magazine.</a></li>
										<li><b>Research Project:</b> With the support of my supervisor and the Sport Product Testing team at the Canadian Sports Institute, I was given the opportunity
										to explore the effects of somatic wearable technology on lower back and hip joint kinematics during high-speed running.
